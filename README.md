# ALMS - ALMS Library Management System

ALMS is a Django Based Library Management System

###__What Can ALMS Do?__
  * Catalog Books
  * Manage Members, volunteers and librarians
  * Lend books, return books
  * Take care of your accounting journal, ledger and trial balances
  * Search For Books based on all their properties

###__How To Install ALMS__

Currently, ALMS is very rigid so I'd recomend not installing the whole system
but rather using parts of it in your own system.
You can also use ALMS as the base for your system.
