Over the span of a few months, Sia grew to become a fully\r\nfunctioning library management system. While, developing Sia, I had the\r\nfollowing `guidelines` in mind (Some of them are rip-offs from the zen of\r\n    python)\r\n\r\n* Easy to use by volunteers with minimal training\r\n* Should support Nepali as it's default language\r\n* Should be simplistic in design\r\n* There should only be one obvious way to do something\r\n* If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.\r\n* Explicit is better than implicit.\r\n\r\nSia Library Software is built using the following projects\r\n\r\n* [Django Web Framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/)\r\n* [JQuery](http://jquery.com/)\r\n* [pyBSDate](https://github.com/SushilShrestha/pyBSDate)\r\n\r\n###__How To Install Siya__\r\n\r\nTo install on a debian system, run this : \r\n\r\n    wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ayys/alms/master/install.sh | sh\r\n\r\n  The above code will start the server and run it in the default browser.\r\n\r\n  To start the server again, simply go to the `alms` directory and run start.sh\r\n\r\n###__Programmer's Documentation__ is on our [wiki page](https://github.com/ayys/alms/wiki)\r\n",
